	The Grey Parrot stories <a title="A brief history of Moose &amp; Goose" href="/moose-and-goose-stories/a-brief-history/">emerged along with</a> the <a title="Moose &amp; Goose Stories" href="/moose-and-goose-stories">Moose &amp; Goose stories</a>, but it was clear they were a different kettle of fish. More suited to a younger audience, 3yo-6yo say, they came about after a news item showed a talking grey parrot who seemed to be too clever by half.

<p style="font-style: italic;">
		Animals with big questions go to the grey parrot for answers,
		<br>and they do get answers,
		<br>but soon wish they had never asked ...
</p>
<p>
	These are short stories for kids, to be read aloud by a grown up at bedtime. They all follow the same theme. There are no pictures. Imaginations are essential. Participation is encouraged. <a title="yes, begged for" href="#respond">Feedback </a>is begged for.
