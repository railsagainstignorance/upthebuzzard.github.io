You are greedy (Tasmanian) devils in a vicious fight for supremacy across the rubbish heap. You win with a pouch full of different foods, above the others.

You can:
* Move: NESW. One step uphill (if not too steep), two on the level, or skid all the way down. You can't stay on a peak, you'll fall. No more than 1 step away onto bedrock.
* Pick up: what you're standing on. No more than 5 things in your pouch, though. Drop (or throw) to make room.
* Drop:
* Dig: into neighbouring hillock.
* Throw: like a Move.
* Fight: Only on the heap. Pick from your pouch, and ... yours is bigger! You win! It falls away downhill (or NESW), but you keep your opponent's.

But how?

Shuffle 52 card deck, face down, in 5x5 piles.

Reveal all top cards to see:
* the rubbish heap: nothing=bedrock, Aces low, Kings high.
* weapons: bigger is better.
* food: any card less than 6.

Each player has
* coins:
   1. for the hill. Start anywhere around the hill.
   2. for synchronizing. Each turn: TAILs to stay (happens 1st), HEADs to move and/or fight. Flip to decide sequencing.
* a private, countable, pouch.
