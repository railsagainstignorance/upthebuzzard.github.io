You are greedy (Tasmanian) devils, on an ever-changing rubbish heap, struggling to get your pouch full of different foods above the others. You fight with what you carry, and it leaches into you, changing who you are, so pick wisely.

Shuffle 52 card deck, face down, in 5x5 piles.

Reveal all top cards to see:
* the rubbish heap: nothing=bedrock, Aces low, Kings high (literally).
* weapons: bigger is better.
* food: any less than 6.

Each player has
* coins:
   1. for the hill. Start on bedrock.
   2. for synchronizing. Each turn, players reveal TAILs stay (happens 1st), HEADs MOVE and/or FIGHT. Toss for sequencing.
* a public pouch. Heart=POUCH+1, Spade=DIG+1, Club=FIGHT+1, Diamond=MOVE+1

You can:
* MOVE: NESW. One step uphill (if <=2 higher), two if level, or slide way down. Can't stay on a peak. Always on or next to heap.
* PICK: what you're standing on. Max 5 things in pouch. DROP / THROW to make room.
* DIG out: from neighbouring hillock.
* DROP / THROW: like MOVE.
* FIGHT: On same heap location. Pick one from your pouches, and ... Yours is bigger! It's THROWn away, but you get your opponent's. A draw? - both THROWn.
