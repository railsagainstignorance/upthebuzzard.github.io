that moment when a group pose, noble in intent and widely-tweeted, most surely ill-advised, takes on a vulgar, crass, probably sexist, sniggeringly funny new interpretation in my own mind, that I can't unsee or unthink, and I'm at a loss as to where or how I can give in to the almost irresistible urge to share said image and its new interpretation in such a way as to minimise any offense caused, and to limit the opprobrium (I looked this word up) that would surely rain down upon me, knowing I should not give in because no good will come of sharing it, except for the blessed, if momentary, catharsis of course.
