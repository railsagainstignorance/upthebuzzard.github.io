Hi,

what you see in these pages is a much belated consequence of a very enjoyable year of bedtime stories improvised by one dad and two sons, aged 4 and 7.

The stories may not make sense to anyone outside my family, but I've set some of the less convoluted ones down here as a resource for anyone who would like to try them out on their own children.

The stories fall into a couple of themes:

* <a title="Moose &amp; Goose Stories" href="/moose_and_goose_stories/">The Moose &amp; Goose Stories</a>, for ages 4-11, ish. Problem solving.
* <a title="The Grey Parrot Stories" href="/grey_parrot_stories/">The Gray Parrot Stories</a>, for younger ones, say, 3-6, ish. Convoluted solutions.

I've gone with the <a title="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0)" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons copyright</a> which basically means you are free to copy, mangle, and share these stories as you see fit, as long as: you attribute me (by citing <a title="Moose &amp; Goose Stories" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/">stories.upthebuzzard.com</a>); you don't make money from them; and you continue with the same copyright if you distribute what you've made of them. It most especially does mean that you are<strong> free to read them out to your kids and mess about vigorously with the details</strong>, which is kind of the whole point.

If you have any feedback on how the stories pan out under battle conditions, <a title="yes, feedback, please" href="#respond">do please let me know</a>.

Feel free to <a title="your note will go to me directly and not appear as a comment" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/about/contact/">contact me</a>.
