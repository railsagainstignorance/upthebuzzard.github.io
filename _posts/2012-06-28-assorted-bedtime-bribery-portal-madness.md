If you, [insert your child's name], have your bath and brush your teeth and pack your bag for tomorrow and unplug the bath and pick your towel up and don’t leave your clothes in a heap on the floor there put them in the clothes bin and why leave your bag in the middle of the hallway where you will fall over it in the night and didn’t I ever tell you how that is not the right way to treat books and have your last drink of water and did I already say to brush your teeth yes I thought so and why didn’t you tell me you had a note from school you need what by tomorrow how am I going to get one of those now all the shops are shut never mind you’ll have to borrow one of [insert your other child's name here]‘s I know its the wrong size but its that or nothing and well you should have thought of that earlier instead of playing on the [insert electronic distraction of choice] when you got home clothes into the clothes bin like I said and get dressed for bed, well, I have something interesting to show you:
<ul>

	<li><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GWI0A9o_5E">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GWI0A9o_5E</a>. Should be obvious after 10secs or so as to basically what is going on. Fancy domino work. But what is being built?</li>

</ul>
