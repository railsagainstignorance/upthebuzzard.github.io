This site is proud to lay claim to certain choice phrases in the global psyche, well, in google results, and to be there or thereabouts on certain others. The identification and search for these phrases is not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Googlewhack">googlewhacking</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egosurfing">egosurfing</a>. No, it is upthebuzzard-surfing.
