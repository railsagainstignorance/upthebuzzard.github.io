Welcome!

This site contains a collection of collections of stories, initially written for (and with) my own kids, then for colleagues and Whoever Else Is Interested (which could be you). Read, enjoy, share, and <a title="Oh do please give some feedback. It is better than cash." href="#respond">give feedback</a>...

<ul>
    <li>the most recent collection is <a title="Predicting The Present" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/predicting-the-present/">Predicting The Present</a>, not for kids as such, more riffing on the now and the near future.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><em>"... The first significant trouble with the simple voting model, however, flared up on the Glasgow/Edinburgh line. Here, commuting traffic went both ways at peak times, and the trains clashed with equal vote totals surprisingly often. Drivers were calling ‘foul’ and demanding recounts, refusing to give way. In some cases, it got down to adjudicated sessions of Rock Paper Scissors between opposing drivers, their passengers gathered round, shouting encouragement or imprecations. Commuting throughput fell, putting the Euro rail integration project in peril. ..." </em>

</ul>

<blockquote>"... <em>A query, passed through the chain of connections back to the leaker-in-hiding, yielded a belated response, laden with expletives, mainly along the lines of “I put my life on the line to get this stuff out and you are complaining I didn’t make it easy enough for you? Stick it in a search engine.”</em>..."

<ul>
    <li>the original collection, for the younger reader (and listener), and the inspiration for all the rest, are the <a title="Moose &amp; Goose Stories" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/moose-goose-stories/">Moose &amp; Goose Stories</a>, as we follow the investigative adventures of two characters who aren't in fact a moose or a goose.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>"... <em>Moose, who knew the way Goose thought, got the same idea very quickly. He drew a picture to explain it to Reginald. They could disguise the cookie oven as an elephant too, making the dough slurping end look like a head with a trunk, cover the oven with a grey cloth, and put the whole thing up on a table with four big grey legs. Reginald nodded. He understood.</em> ..."

</ul>

<blockquote><strong>"... <em>Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher</em></strong><em> by Bruce Coville.</em>

<em>Not too long. Touches all the childhood themes. And has a dragon in it. What’s not to like? The book builds up to a emotional climax that left the audience in tears. Great stuff.
