Starting with a <a title="Predicting The Present" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/predicting-the-present/">Predicting The Present</a> story, <a title="Emus all the way down" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/2013/06/29/emus-all-the-way-down/">EMUs all the way down</a>, and taking it a bit further, exploring some nooks and crannies. Followable via <a href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/category/extrapolations/feed/">RSS</a>.

Very slow progress. Is there a full-length novel in here somewhere? Not at the rate I'm going. But it appears I can write in bursts of about 1000 words if the immediate topic appeals. This marathon is a series of sprints. Trying to work it into shape.

Pieces so far:

<h2>the main protagonist</h2>

who's there at the start (or one of the starts) and works out what happens at the end

<h2>glossary</h2>

<ul>
    <li>NPC : non playing character in a computer game, similar to an 'extra' in a film. Usually a very simple automaton, considered cannon (or sword) fodder, but sometimes there to help move the (paying) human-driven characters along with hints about what they should do next..</li>
