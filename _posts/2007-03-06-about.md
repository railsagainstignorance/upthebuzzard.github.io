Hi,

what you see in these pages is a much belated consequence of a very enjoyable year of bedtime stories improvised by one dad and two sons, aged 4 and 7.

The stories may not make sense to anyone outside my family, but I've set some of the less convoluted ones down here as a resource for anyone who would like to try them out on their own children.

The stories fall into a couple of themes:
<ul>
	<li><a title="Moose &amp; Goose Stories" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/">Moose &amp; Goose</a>, for ages 4-11, ish. Problem solving.</li>
	<li><a title="The Grey Parrot Stories" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/the-grey-parrot-stories/">The Gray Parrot</a>, for younger ones, say, 3-6, ish. Convoluted solutions.</li>
</ul>
I've gone with the <a title="Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-NC-SA 3.0)" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative Commons copyright</a> which basically means you are free to copy, mangle, and share these stories as you see fit, as long as: you attribute me (by citing <a title="Moose &amp; Goose Stories" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/" target="_blank">stories.upthebuzzard.com</a>); you don't make money from them; and you continue with the same copyright if you distribute what you've made of them. It most especially does mean that you are<strong> free to read them out to your kids and mess about vigorously with the details</strong>, which is kind of the whole point.

If you have any feedback on how the stories pan out under battle conditions, <a title="yes, feedback, please" href="#respond">do please let me know</a>.

P.S., many thanks to <a title="Cory Doctorow's site with all his scifi, near future, and now future, writing" href="http://craphound.com/" target="_blank">Cory Doctorow</a> for responding to an email out of the blue from a complete stranger who had some questions about his Creative Commons philosophy, and pointing out <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2006/11/30/cory-doctorow-copyright-tech-media_cz_cd_books06_1201doctorow.html" target="_blank">some</a> <a href="http://www.locusmag.com/Features/2007/09/cory-doctorow-freekonomic-e-books.html" target="_blank">useful</a> <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2007/03/20/model-contract-claus.html" target="_blank">articles</a> to said stranger.

P.P.S., I have read and enjoyed Cory Doctorow's <a href="http://craphound.com/ftw/about/" target="_blank">For The Win</a>, but it was not a kids book so is not really relevant here.
