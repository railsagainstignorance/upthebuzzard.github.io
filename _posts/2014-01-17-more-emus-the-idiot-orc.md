“But the idiot orc splashed across my stream straight at the dwarf with the massively fatal axe. Not at the vulnerable, unarmed fairie over there with all the jewels. No. What’s the point of making splashed water drops sparkle realistically in the setting sun’s light, if the idiot orc is going to commit suicide-by-dwarf-with-a-bloody-great-axe?

No-one looks at the water drops, but they do look at the idiot NPCs displaying all the practical genius of moths round a candle flame. There is no challenge here for the players. All we do is throw more idiot orcs at them and hope they get tired, which they don’t. Bored, maybe.”

“Jen is a top-grade AI architect. I’m sure she’s got an algorithm or two up her sleeve to give them some smarts.”

“Groan. Here we go. ‘<em>Jen did it before and she’ll do it again.</em>’ After winning the Elisa competition and then the Turing Test with her bot, she gets the big bucks and the NPCs to play with. She stole my code!”

<!--more-->“Your *open source* code. Your *creative commons share-alike* code. She cited you and profusely credited you with having built the main chat engine.”

“Ah, yes, but, she hardly made any changes to it”.

“So why didn’t you make those few small changes and win the competitions yourself?”

“I was busy.”

“Doing what? Drinking? Playing Halo?”

“... Experimenting with the wrong changes, is what I was doing. Sigh.

Alright, maybe she did deserve it, but what has she done since? These orcs are pathetic. They are the same pathetic as they were last year. The #1 most repeated complaint slash suggestion from our players is to make the NPCs less stupid. But we have not done that. They did not ask for sparkly water drops, which I have given them, or these ripples that flow and fade downstream. I can give them leaves which wobble fetchingly in a light breeze. But will the Uncles let me make some kick-ass NPCs who might win the occasional fight?”

“I don’t know. Will they? Have you asked? Why have a go at me? I just order the stationary. No-one listens to me; I'm just the Scrum Master”

“I can’t go against Jen and the other Uncles. They totally support her. I’m replaceable; she isn’t. Except she should be. Argh.”

“Yes, one does have a certain amount of sway, as the one who pumped all of one's competition winnings straight into founding a games company which employs talented but otherwise demonstrably unemployable friends and colleagues.

Damn those people who earn their rewards and then do good with them.”

“You’re just saying that because you're a ...“

“I’m a ... what, exactly?”

“erm, unable to think rationally about this.”

“I’m a-unable to think rationally? About this?
Do you use this line of argument with your girlfriend?
You do have a girlfriend, right?
Yes, of course you do. I’ve met her.
She seemed nice which is why I was confused.
So, yes, is she also a-unable to think rationally?
Often, or indeed ever?
Have you let her know your thoughts on her a-inability?
If you’ve yet to let her know, I’m happy to give you feedback on how that line is working right now.
See, the thing is, its not working too well.
I’m waiting for your next few words.
Quite a lot hangs on them.
Some choices may not end in violence.
So, what have you got?”

“Imagine I hadn’t said that last sentence.
Or started the one before that.”

“Nope, thing is, you did.
I remember.
I was there, and so were you.
Strike one by the way.”

“erm, it didn’t come out right?”

“*I* told *you* that.
I still don’t see any significant improvement in your situation.
Strike only one left.”

“ah, it is *just* possible that through a lack of care on my part I may have inadvertently let slip a choice of words which could be easily misconstrued in such a way as to cause offence, and that since this was entirely my fault I accept full responsibility, and in the spirit of friendship and cooperation and in no way attempting to bribe you into not calling in a full scale attack by the sisters on my male sexist pig ass, I would be happy nay delighted to help sort out your laptop Windows setup which I hear has been getting on your ti-nerves.”

“oh, nicely played and yet so nearly lost at the last ti-moment.
Tomorrow would be good, during lunch.
I’m off home now.
Bye.”
