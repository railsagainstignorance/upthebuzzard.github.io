Hi Chris, I am your cousin ( Judith's sister), my husband and I are coming to Britain and Europe leaving tomorrow. We are going to be in London from 6th-12th June. We are then going travelling around Britain. Do you want to meet up in London? I will have technology so can be contacted on the above email.
Cheers
Helen and Ian.
I asked for your email address but your Mum and Dad didn't get back to me.
