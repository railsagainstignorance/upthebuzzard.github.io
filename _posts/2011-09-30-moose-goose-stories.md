Welcome!

Here are some short bedtime stories for kids, roughly in the age range of <a title="yes, yes, such a large suggested age range may not seem much use, but different ages get different things out of the stories" href="#respond">4-11</a> (or younger ones <a title="The Grey Parrot Stories" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/the-grey-parrot-stories/">over here</a>), to be read aloud by a grown up to help with the occasional long word. The stories are <a title="how and why are they free?" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/about/">available for free</a>, and are ad-free, but please Please <em>PLEASE</em> <a href="#respond">give me some feedback</a> (good or bad, anonymously, briefly, verbosely, doesn't matter,  just let me know).

There is a <a title="A brief history of Moose &amp; Goose" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/about/a-brief-history-of-moose-and-goose/">potted history</a> of how Moose &amp; Goose came to be, but all you really need to know is:

<div>"I have a problem. I own a zoo in town, as you know, and it’s been getting a bit quiet. Not many people are visiting. They seem a bit bored with it. We want to do a re-launch, generate lots of publicity, get more people to visit. You know the sort of thing. We need a theme, something interesting, something exciting, something that will get this town buzzing."</div></blockquote>

We cannot force people to use suncream. We cannot officially go on to the beaches and try and convince the sunbathers directly because the two main beaches in this town are private."</blockquote>

<div>These stories all follow the same theme. There are no pictures. Imaginations are essential. Participation is encouraged, especially in the brainstorming sections (where '...' means the audience is meant to contribute). <a title="yes, begged for" href="#respond">Feedback </a>is begged for.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is no commercial printing of these stories (<a title="feedback, feedback, feedback" href="#respond">yet</a>). They can be read out quite satisfactorily from a smartphone (iphone, android, et al), a tablet (ipad, android, et al). In fact, field studies have shown that the gently glowing screen in a darkened room works really well, adding a sense of drama. The stories seem to transfer ok to <a title="a read-it-later service" href="http://www.instapaper.com" target="_blank">instapaper</a>, and that gives you a route onto your Kindle (...although you'll need the lights on to read from that). The stories can be picked up via the<a title="RSS feed of every post" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/feed" target="_blank"> '<em>includes everything</em>'</a> RSS feed, or via the '<em><a title="RSS feed of Moose &amp; Goose stories only" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/category/moose-goose/feed" target="_blank">Moose &amp; Goose only</a></em>' RSS feed, which show the stories in the order in which they are released.</div>
