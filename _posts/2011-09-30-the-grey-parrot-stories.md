The Gray Parrot stories <a title="A brief history of Moose &amp; Goose" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/about/a-brief-history-of-moose-and-goose/">emerged along with</a> the <a title="Moose &amp; Goose Stories" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/">Moose &amp; Goose stories</a>, but it was clear they were a different kettle of fish. More suited to a younger audience, 3yo-6yo say, they came about after a news item showed a talking grey parrot who seemed to be too clever by half.
<p style="text-align:center;">Animals with big questions go to the grey parrot for answers,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">and they do get answers,</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">but soon wish they had never asked in the first place.</p>
These are short stories for kids, to be read aloud by a grown up at bedtime. They all follow the same theme. There are no pictures. Imaginations are essential. Participation is encouraged. <a title="yes, begged for" href="#respond">Feedback </a>is begged for.

<blockquote>"The marmalade elephant was not happy.

His elephant friends blended in with the colours and shapes of the grass and bushes. But the marmalade elephant was a bright orange against green grass. You could almost hear how bright he was."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One night, by the river, a nosey baboon saw a bright shiny thing in the calm water, and wondered what it was."</blockquote>
There is no commercial printing of these stories (<a title="feedback, feedback, feedback" href="http://upthebuzzard.wordpress.com/#respond">yet</a>). They can be read out quite satisfactorily from a smartphone (iphone, android, et al), a tablet (ipad, android, et al). In fact, field studies have shown that the gently glowing screen in a darkened room works really well, adding a sense of drama. The stories seem to transfer ok to <a title="a read-it-later service" href="http://www.instapaper.com/" target="_blank">instapaper</a>, and that gives you a route onto your Kindle (…although you’ll need the lights on to read from that). The stories can be picked up via the<a title="RSS feed of every post" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/feed" target="_blank"> '<em>includes everything</em>'</a> RSS feed, or via the <a title="RSS feed of The Grey Parrot stories" href="http://stories.upthebuzzard.com/category/the-grey-parrot/feed" target="_blank">'<em>The Grey Parrot</em>' </a>RSS feed, which show the stories in the order in which they are released.
