# Sorry, but, um, that page you wanted? It isn't there.

As for why, quite possibly that is a story in and of itself, in which case you've definitely come to the right place.

Leap, gazelle-like, to the [home page]({{ site.url }}) to see what stories are offer and, more importantly, where they actually are. As opposed to, you know, wherever you thought they were.

* a study of world leaders' consciences discovers _404 Not Found_
* looking through the list of all Boeing plane numbers, it turns out _404 Not Found_
* the second worst band name in the age of the internet, after "The the", is _404 Not Found_

* quite a long way down the list of famous Swedish names, we stumble on _404 Knut Found_
* Simon Squirrel is looking to buy and then store a very specific amount of food for the winter, so has started the _404 Nut Fund_
* after a triumph of personal grooming using one those very fine-toothed combs, we consider today to be the _404 Nit Find_
* half-way through the instructions of "create your own woollen palm tree", we read _404 Knit Frond_
* ...
